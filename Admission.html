<h2>Note about immunization:</h2>
<ul>

<p>A <strong>CIS form</strong> must be used, must be current and updated yearly (more frequently for infants).  All children must be current on their immunizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> take children whose immunizations are not up to date. If your child has a reason that he couldn’t have a particular immunization, please talk to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a signed exemption to immunizations, the child may need to be excluded from child care if there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease that the child has not been immunized for.</p></li></ul>
