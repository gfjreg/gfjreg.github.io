##Medical Emergencies##

-  We have First Aid, Child CPR, and HIV/Aids/Blood Born Pathogens Prevention training.

-  Minor cuts, bruises, and scrapes will be treated.  Clients will be notified upon arrival. With some minor injuries clients will be called to help decide whether the child should go home.

-  In the event of a serious injury or emergency, we will call 911 and administer first aid or CPR if needed.  We will then notify you as soon as possible and tell you where your child is being treated. 

##Medicine Management##
- **We DO NOT give any medication**. This includes prescription and over the counter medications such as:

    - Anti-histamines (medicines that help stop allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, sneezing and a runny nose)

    - Non–steroidal anti–inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): such as, Advil, Ibuprofen, Motrin, …etc.

    - Non-aspirin pain relievers and fever reducers, such as Tylenol …etc. 

    - Cough medicine 

    - Decongestants 

    - Allergy medicine: such as Benadryl…etc.

    - Anti-itching creams 

    - Diaper ointments and powders 

    - Sunscreen

- For the safety of your child, the medicine you give at home needs to be documented daily on the calendar in your child’s chart for confidentiality. If 911 were to be called, they need to know what is in the child’s body, even if it is cold medicine. Honestly please!
