There are several forms you are required to complete prior to your child's attendance:

-  [KidsKare Academy Registration Form]({{ site.url}}/forms/ChildCare_RegistrationForm.pdf)
-  [KidsKare Academy Aggrement]({{ site.url}}/forms/ChildCareAgreement.pdf)
-  [Certificate of Immunization Status Form]({{ site.url}}/forms/cis.pdf)

##Note about immunization:##
- A **CIS form** must be used, must be current and updated yearly (more frequently for infants).  All children must be current on their immunizations.
 
- We **DO NOT** take children whose immunizations are not up to date. If your child has a reason that he couldnâ€™t have a particular immunization, please talk to us.


- If there is a signed exemption to immunizations, the child may need to be excluded from child care if there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease that the child has not been immunized for.
