**However, if clients need child care on these days, please contact us. Care may be available for some of these holidays with advance reservation at an additional charge (whole day rate).**

Other reasons child care home may be closed: 

- Loss of electricity or loss of water 

- Any emergency that closes Lake Washington School District’s schools.

##Snow policy##
**We follow Northshore School District’s decision.**

###For child care  
-  If it is “school closed”, our Family Child Care will be closed. If the clients really need child care for that day, please contact us and we may be able to arrange child care for your children. Clients will be responsible to pay for the child care in a whole day rate on site at time of pickup. 

-  If it's "early dismiss", we'll go to school to pick up the children if we are notified by the school or parents 30 minutes prior to the dismiss time.  (We may be in the homeschool center in Bellevue at that time, so we need an at least 30 minutes notification to be able to come back to Kirkland.)  Clients will be responsible to notify us about the early dismiss and pick up time. Clients will also be responsible to pay for the extra hours in drop-in rate on site at time of pickup. 

-  If it’s “late start”, clients can still send the children here at the contracted time in the morning for before school child care. But clients will be responsible to pay for the extra hours in the drop-in rate on site at time of pickup. And we will remain open for the after school child care without extra charge. 

### For classes only (e.g. Chinese classes, Math classes, ..., etc.): 
-  If it is “school closed” or "early dismiss", all classes will be canceled. We'll schedule make-up class(es) with parents. Because our class size is small, we will try to find a time that works for all the families. No refund or credit will be issued if a student misses the make-up class(es). 
-  If it's "late start" only, we'll still have classes.
