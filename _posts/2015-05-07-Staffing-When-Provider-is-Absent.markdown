title: Staffing When Provider is Absent
---

----------

There will be no sub-teacher when the provider is sick. So the provider's personal sick days are of no charge because we are closing for the day. We’ll prorate it and deduct the amount from your next month’s payment. If an extended illness or an unforeseen situation causes the provider to close other than the above mentioned, there will be no charges for those days. 

#Back-up Child Care#

----------

We recommend that you have access to an alternate child care arrangement.  You may need care if the provider is ill or when the provider is on vacation.  If the provider is ill you will be notified as soon as possible so that you can make other arrangements.  It is always your responsibility to find backup child care.
