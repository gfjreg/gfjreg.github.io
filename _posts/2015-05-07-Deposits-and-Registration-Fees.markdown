----------
- **Registration Fee**:  There is a non-refundable registration fee of **$35 per child, $50 per family** per school year for processing the paperwork required for enrollment and re-enrollment.

- **Deposit**:  Clients will pay for the last two weeks of child care in advance upon signing the agreement. 

- **Holding Fee**: $50. 

    If you cannot start the child care right away and would like us to hold the spot for your child, your child's position is reserved upon receipt of a non-refundable holding fee which will be applied to the payment for care once the child is enrolled.
