----------


- Arrival and pick-up instructions: 

    When arriving, the parent, guardian or authorized person must sign the child in, and sign-out at pick up time.  The sign-in/sign out form is located at the front door.   You are required to sign in/out using full name, date and time.   

- Please identify on the Child Care Home Register who is authorized to pick up your child.  
    We will not release your child to any person without your written permission.  The person picking up your child must have identification, as we may ask for verification of identity before releasing a child.  

- Anyone who appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol arriving at child care to pick up a child will be asked to call someone else to pick up that child.  
    If a person leaves with a child while they appear to be under the influence, we will call 911.
