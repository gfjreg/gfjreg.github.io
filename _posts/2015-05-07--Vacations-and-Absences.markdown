----------

- No deductions will be made from the monthly rate when service is available; such as child arrives late, or departs early, or you and your child are on vacation, or child does not require service for any reason.  

- When you go on vacation, payment is due before you leave.  

- Please call and inform us when your child will not attend due to illness or some other event. 

- Please advise us upon enrollment if you plan to remove your child from child care for any length of time (i.e. vacations, or when you are on maternity leave with another child, etc.).
