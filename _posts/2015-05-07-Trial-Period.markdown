----------

###The trial period for after school child care is 4 weeks.###
  This period is used to observe the child's adjustment to care and to talk about concerns.  The provider will talk to you about your child's day often.  Please tell us if you have any concerns.  After the trial period, we will determine if the child care services are satisfactory to everyone.  If any problems cannot be resolved, the care is terminated.

During this time, either the clients or the provider may terminate the agreement without written notice. 

-     If the contract is terminated during the trial period due to the client's will, the client will pay $8/hour for the service provided and pay for any early drop-off fee or late pick-up fee charged to the client, and get refund for the amount left.

-     If the contract is terminated during the trial period due to the provider's will, the client will pay a prorated rate for the service provided and pay for any early drop-off fee or late pick-up fee charged to the client, and get refund for the amount left. 

###Trial period for summer camps (for new enrollments only): ###

Either clients or the provider may terminate the care during these 3 days of trial period without written notice. If care is terminated during the trial period, clients will pay $40/day for the care provided and any early drop-off fee or late pick-up fee charged to the client and get refund for the amount left.
