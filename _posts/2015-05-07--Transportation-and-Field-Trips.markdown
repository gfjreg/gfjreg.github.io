----------


##Transportation##

-  For after-school program: we will go to Moorlands Elementary School and Frost and Muir Elementary to pick up your children. Clients are responsible for transport their children home.

-  For children who don’t attend Frost or Muir Elementary, clients are responsible for transportation.

-  We have 7 seat belts in our minivan.  Everyone over 80 pounds/8 years old is buckled at all times.  If your child is under 80 pounds/8 years old, please provide a car seat/booster seat if you need us to pick up your kids from their school.

-  A first aid kit and the provider's first aid/CPR certification will be in the vehicle at all time.

-  For school break camps & summer camps: clients are responsible for transportation.

##Field Trips##

We will not provide field trips on regular after-school days.

We may provide field trips during school-break camps and summer camps. If we do, clients will need to sign a permission slip ahead of time and bring a sack of lunch and drink for their children on the field trip day. If clients decide not to let their children attend the field trip, it’s the clients’ responsibility to find a child care for that day.
