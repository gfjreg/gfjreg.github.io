title: Items Brought From Home
---

----------
-  Candy is never encouraged at our family child care unless it is a holiday or birthday. 

-  Children are encouraged to leave toys at home. We have an ample supply of toys and activities to keep your child busy during the day. However, if your child does bring in toys from home, they will be expected to share or share or will be asked to put them away. We cannot assume responsibility for loss or damage to any personal possessions children bring into our family child care home. It is distressing for children to misplace or lose belongings and sometimes difficult for teachers to identify the owner. Please help your child understand why it is not wise to bring toys or other objects that they may not wish to share with other children.

-  Comforting items such as security blankets, pillow, baby-dolls, and stuffed animals are OK.

-  ABSOLUTELY NO TOY GUNS OR WEAPONS WILL BE ALLOWED AT OUR CHILD CARE HOME. GUM IS ALSO OFF LIMITS HERE.
